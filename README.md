# üçè Machine Learning Web App - Apple Quality Prediction 

This is a **machine learning web application** project (developed for the college laboratory) that predicts outcomes based on the [**Apple Quality Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality) dataset. It uses **Node.js with Express.js & EJS**  for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend, based on the [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ravesandstorm/apple-svm-92-cv) by [Satvik](https://github.com/ravesandstorm/).

## Tech Stack
### Ishita
- **Frontend:** Node.js, Express.js, EJS ‚Äì Manages the UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Process based on [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ravesandstorm/apple-svm-92-cv)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Applying All Classifiers  

The following six models were applied to classify apples into **good or bad** quality:  

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Na√Øve Bayes**  
- **Gradient Boosting**  

Each model was evaluated using the following **metrics**:  

- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-Score**  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Normalization & Scaling  

To improve model performance, the dataset was **normalized and scaled** using four different techniques:  

- **L1 Normalization**  
- **L2 Normalization**  
- **Standard Scaling**  
- **MinMax Scaling**  

Each model was then **re-evaluated** after scaling, and the results were recorded.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation  

To optimize model performance, **GridSearchCV** was used for **hyperparameter tuning**, along with **10-fold cross-validation** to find the best model.  

The models were evaluated again using:  

- **Cross-validated Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-Score**  

The best model **SVM** with **92.075% Cross Validation Accuracy** was selected based on these metrics, and then **FastAPI** was configured to run on the backend using the **Uvicorn** module, using the best model hyperparameters discovered in the notebook, developed by [Satvik](https://github.com/ravesandstorm/).

Node modules and frontend scripts with **ejs and js** were processed and developed by me.
