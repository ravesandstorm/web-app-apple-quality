# üçè Machine Learning Web App - Apple Quality Prediction 

This project is a **machine learning web application** that predicts outcomes based on different datasets, including **Apple Quality Prediction**. It uses **FastAPI** for the backend and **Node.js with Express.js & EJS** for the frontend.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) ‚Äì Handles ML model predictions.
- **Frontend:** Node.js, Express.js, EJS ‚Äì Manages the UI.
- **Styling:** CSS ‚Äì Custom UI design.
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas.

## üìÇ Dataset  

The dataset used is `apple_quality.csv`, containing features such as:  

- **Size**  
- **Weight**  
- **Crunchiness**  
- **Juiciness**  
- **Ripeness**  
- **Acidity**
- **Quality**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Process  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Apply 6 Classifiers  

The following six models were applied to classify apples into **good or bad** quality:  

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Na√Øve Bayes**  
- **Gradient Boosting**  

Each model was evaluated using the following **metrics**:  

- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-Score**  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Normalization & Scaling  

To improve model performance, the dataset was **normalized and scaled** using four different techniques:  

- **L1 Normalization**  
- **L2 Normalization**  
- **Standard Scaling**  
- **MinMax Scaling**  

Each model was then **re-evaluated** after scaling, and the results were recorded.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation  

To optimize model performance, **GridSearchCV** was used for **hyperparameter tuning**, along with **10-fold cross-validation** to find the best model.  

The models were evaluated again using:  

- **Cross-validated Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-Score**  

The **best model** was selected based on these metrics.
